Hi! I’m Okina. I design and build distributed systems, coach engineering teams, and spend weekends capturing travel stories on film and digital cameras.

- **Day job**: platform engineering, developer tooling, reliability reviews.
- **Creative work**: bilingual blogging, analog photography, motion edits.
- **Values**: slow web, privacy, and intentional technology.

This site is my digital garden — a calm space to publish field notes without algorithmic timelines.
