> **Design Notes** · Calm gradients, focused typography, and a homepage that mirrors the official Blowfish experience.

Thanks for visiting the refreshed site. The layout now follows the Blowfish background style: the hero banner floats over a gradient image, the author profile stays visible, and recent posts are rendered as cards. Language-aware routing keeps English and Chinese content separated while sharing the same structure.

- Hugo Extended with Blowfish 2, defaulting to dark mode with automatic appearance switching
- Tailwind-flavored components, smart table of contents, reading-time and taxonomy badges by default
- Article heroes feature background photography and pagination, with sharing links for every post
- Use `npm run dev` for local previews and `npm run build` for production artifacts
